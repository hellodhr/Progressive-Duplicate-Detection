# Progressive-Duplicate-Detection
This is a Java based application which was built to detect duplicate detection is a large dataset. In our case we used a 'dblp' dataset. This duplicate detection is done using PSNM and PB algorithms. These algorithms were proposed in an IEEE paper named 'Progressive Duplicate Detection using PSNM and PB algorithms'.
